The main concept of the topic is assigning jobs to multiple machines in order for them to be
processed in parallel (Parallel Machine Scheduling - PMS). When jobs are processed in parallel
in multiple machines the total execution time is reduced. This objective is often referred in the
bibliography as minimization of makespan, which is simply the minimization of the total time for all
the jobs to finish
